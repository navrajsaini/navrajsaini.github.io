        <p>
            I am a Computer Science major at the University of Lethbridge. This website is used as a way for me to build my portfolio as well as a way for me to access and improve upon my skills in<br />
            C++ as well as the other languages I am learning or will be learning.

            Programming is a great tool which should be taught to individuals of all ages. It teaches problem solving skills as well as a new way of approach towards problems encountered in everyday life.<br />
            It also allows individuals to learn something that might seem intimidating at first, which eventually becomes enjoyable.
