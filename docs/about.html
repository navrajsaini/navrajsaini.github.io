<h1>About me</h1>
    <h2>Navraj Saini</h2>
    <p>I am a Computer Science major at the University of Lethbridge. This website is used as a way for me to build my portfolio as well as a way for me to access and improve upon my skills in c++ as well as the other languages I am learning or will be learning.</p>
    
    <p>Programming is a great tool which should be taught to individuals of all ages. It teaches problem solving skills as well as a new way of approach towards problems encountered in everyday life. It also allows individuals to learn something that might seem intimidating at first, which eventually becomes enjoyabel.</p>
